# FindCorrectInvoiceCombination

This is an "exponential possibility problem" challenge.
Use example: <br>
A customer has 8 (or more) unpaid invoices.<br>
He now has paid a certain amount but I don't know for which of the 8 invoices 
and I don't know for how many invoices the amount covers.<br>
So our code will find out which invoices are covered by the amount.<br>
It could be 2 or 3 or 4 or more invoices that have been paid.<br>
The current code can also handle float values.<br>
I received a payment of €139 and I need to find out which invoices I need to combine to get the total value of €139.<br><br>
Invoices amounts: €10, €22, €14, €35, €82<br>
Correct result for €139 =  €22 + €35 + €82.<br><br>
